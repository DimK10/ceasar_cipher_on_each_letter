# Ceasar Cipher on each letter with different alphabet

This program gets a number, duplicates it until length_of_number_digits = length_of_txt_to_cipher

 and then, it reads each leatter and for each letter, it uses as n the corresponding digit (so for 
 each letter a new alphabet for ceaser cipher is used).

 Finally, it creates a new file, and fills it with the ciphered text.

 The decryption process is basically the same steps in reversed order.
